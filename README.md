# Angular Assessment Saxum

## Requirements

Build a single page app with a sign-up form.

- The form should allow users to enter first name, last name, email, and password.
- All fields are required.
- Password validation:
  - Should be a minimum of eight characters,
  - Should contain lower and uppercase letters, o Should not contain userâ€™s first or last name.
  - Email should be validated but there are various ways of accomplishing this. So, show us what you consider as a proper email validation.
- The form should send a POST request to https://demo-api.now.sh/users.

Because Angular provides eveything i didn't need to add any libraries. I did however add Bootstrap as a CDN for easy styling.
